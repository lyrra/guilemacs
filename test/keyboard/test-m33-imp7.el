;;; test-m33-imp7.el --- M33 imp-7 (close-out audit) suite.
;;;
;;; Pins the M33 imp-7 close-out (brief.org): the two stub retirements
;;; (show_help_echo, discard_mouse_events) leave no caller, definition,
;;; or extern; the two migrated names have no C storage; and the
;;; anchored Job 1 counts match the brief table.
;;;
;;; Wraps test/keyboard/test-m33-imp7.scm -- the Scheme audit corpus.
;;; Binds the repo root as %m33-root, loads the Scheme file via
;;; eval-scheme, then reads back `test-results' (list of (NAME STATUS)
;;; pairs).  Each (NAME PASS|FAIL) pair is reported via princ AND turned
;;; into an ERT test so the harness counts it.  Each (NAME INFO VALUE)
;;; pair is printed as an INFO line and is NOT asserted.  A corpus load
;;; error, a readback error or an empty corpus is reported as a real
;;; FAIL (never a silent 0 failed).
