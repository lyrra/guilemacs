;;; test-m34-imp2.el --- M34 imp-2 (frame.c swallow/single-kboard) suite.
;;;
;;; Pins the M34 imp-2 port (brief.org): the decision logic of the two
;;; live src/frame.c call sites of keyboard extern stubs moved into the
;;; new module (emacs frame).  src/frame.c now calls two static
;;; dispatchers; no stub retires.
;;;
;;; Wraps test/keyboard/test-m34-imp2.scm -- the Scheme audit corpus.
;;; Binds the repo root as %m34-root, loads the Scheme file via
;;; eval-scheme, then reads back `test-results' (list of (NAME STATUS)
;;; pairs).  Each (NAME PASS|FAIL) pair is reported via princ AND turned
;;; into an ERT test so the harness counts it.  Each (NAME INFO VALUE)
;;; pair is printed as an INFO line and is NOT asserted.  A corpus load
;;; error, a readback error or an empty corpus is reported as a real
;;; FAIL (never a silent 0 failed).
