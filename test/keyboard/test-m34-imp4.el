;;; test-m34-imp4.el --- M34 imp-4 (minibuf.c input-state callers) suite.
;;;
;;; Pins the M34 imp-4 port (brief.org): the decision logic of the live
;;; src/minibuf.c call sites moved into the new module (emacs minibuf).
;;; src/minibuf.c now calls nine static dispatchers; no stub retires and
;;; no DEFVAR_* site leaves C.
;;;
;;; Wraps test/keyboard/test-m34-imp4.scm -- the Scheme audit corpus.
;;; Binds the repo root as %m34-root, loads the Scheme file via
;;; eval-scheme, then reads back `test-results' (list of (NAME STATUS)
;;; pairs).  Each (NAME PASS|FAIL) pair is reported via princ AND turned
;;; into an ERT test so the harness counts it.  Each (NAME INFO VALUE)
;;; pair is printed as an INFO line and is NOT asserted.  A corpus load
;;; error, a readback error or an empty corpus is reported as a real
;;; FAIL (never a silent 0 failed).
