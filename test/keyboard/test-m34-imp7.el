;;; test-m34-imp7.el --- M34 imp-7 (close-out) suite.
;;;
;;; Pins the M34 imp-7 close-out (brief.org): the three stub
;;; retirements (safe_run_hooks_2, push_kboard, not_single_kboard_state)
;;; leave no definition, extern, or caller; the kept stubs keep a live C
;;; caller; and the anchored surface counts match the brief table.
;;;
;;; Wraps test/keyboard/test-m34-imp7.scm -- the Scheme audit corpus.
;;; Binds the repo root as %m34-root, loads the Scheme file via
;;; eval-scheme, then reads back `test-results' (list of (NAME STATUS)
;;; pairs).  Each (NAME PASS|FAIL) pair is reported via princ AND turned
;;; into an ERT test so the harness counts it.  Each (NAME INFO VALUE)
;;; pair is printed as an INFO line and is NOT asserted.  A corpus load
;;; error, a readback error or an empty corpus is reported as a real
;;; FAIL (never a silent 0 failed).
